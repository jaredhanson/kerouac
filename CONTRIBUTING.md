# Contributing to `kerouac`

## Getting Started

To contribute to this package, you'll need a working development environment
with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/).  Once these
tools are set up, you can start development by executing the following commands:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/jaredhanson/kerouac.git
$ cd kerouac
$ make test
```

A typical development workflow is as follows:

```sh
# ... hack hack hack ...
$ make test
$ git status                # review changes
$ git diff                  # review changes
$ git add --all
$ git commit                # commit changes
$ git push origin master
```

## Development

### Tests

The test suite is located in the [`test/`](https://github.com/jaredhanson/kerouac/tree/master/test) directory.
Tests are written and run using the [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) test
framework, along with [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) assertions and [Sinon](https://sinonjs.org/)
mocks.

All new features are expected to have corresponding test cases with (reasonably)
complete code coverage.  Patches that increase test coverage are happily
accepted!

The test suite can be run by executing:

```sh
$ make test
```

Coverage reports can be generated by running the test suite instrumented with
[Istanbul](https://istanbul.js.org/):

```sh
$ make test-cov
$ make view-cov
```
